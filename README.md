# <Prework Study Guide web page>

## Description

This is a study guide for students that are going through the coding bootcamp. My motivation for creating this webpage was to make an easier path for future students and a resource for these individuals coming directly from someone who has already gone through what they are about to go through. That is the reason why I built this project, to make the journey easier on those following behind me. I believe that my study guide solves the problem of students being slightly overwhelmed with alot of very intricate readings that might be hard to understand. I also believe that this study guide would stream line the important information in a faster way. I've learned many things from HTML, CSS, JavaScript and not only learning about these functionalities themselves but the different elements that reside underneath them and how they all work together to build a webpage. This is the knowledge I hope to pass on to anybody that comes across this study guide.
